# Linear and Nonlinear Regression – Visual Demonstration with Manim

**Author:** Mariana Capuñay

**Date:** January 2026


-----
This project presents a short educational video illustrating the principles of linear and
nonlinear regression using the Manim Community library. The video is inspired by the
visual explanatory style of the 3Blue1Brown YouTube channel.



## Requirements
- Python 3.10+
- manim
- numpy

## Setup
Clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Mariana-Capunay/linear-nonlinear-regression-manim.git
cd linear-nonlinear-regression-manim
pip install numpy manim
```

## Run

```bash
manim -pqh main.py RegressionScene
```

## Output
The final video is rendered in MPEG format and illustrates:
- Linear regression in 2D
- Error minimization
- Multivariate regression
- Nonlinear (polynomial) regression

## Final Video Demo
The final rendered video (including background music added during post-production)
is available at:



Note: The video included in this repository corresponds to the raw Manim render
(without audio). Background music was added during post-production to produce
the final video demo.
